### Hi, I'm Martje! ðŸ‘‹

I've recently completed a 3-month data science training and am now working on projects for my portfolio. Being a very curious and creative person, I love the moment when you can generate meaningful insights from a bunch of text and numbers. With my background in psychology, I'm especially interested in the intersection of social and behavioral sciences, HCI, and computer science.
